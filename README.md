# 🏡Airbnb-clone-project
For Backend

## 📖Overview
This is a backend-focused learning project that recreates the main features of Airbnb's platform.It is designed to help practice skills on backend development, database modelling, authentication, and scalable system designs

### 🏆Project goals
- Implement secure **user registration, login and profile management.**
- Build **property listings** with create , update and retrieval features.
- Add **payment processing** to handle transactions securely.
- Support a **review system** where users can leave ratings and comments.
- Improve efficiency with **database indexing and caching.**

### ⚙️Technology stack

- **Django** - Web framework for backend development
- **Django REST Framework** - REST API support
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational Database
- **GraphQL** - Flexible data queries
- **Celery** - Task queue for background jobs
- **Redis** - Caching and session handling
- **Docker** - Containerization for development and deployment
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated testing and deployments

## 👥Team roles

A successful Airbnb Clone project involves collaboration between different specialists, each with a unique responsibility.  

### 🔹 Backend Developer
Responsible for building the application’s **business logic, API endpoints, and database models**. They ensure the system runs smoothly, data flows correctly, and features like authentication, bookings, and payments work securely.

### 🔹 Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, manages, and optimizes the **database structure**. They implement indexing, backups, and security measures to keep data reliable, consistent, and fast to retrieve.

### 🔹 DevOps Engineer
Ensures smooth **deployment, scaling, and monitoring** of the application. They set up Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure so the system is reliable and easy to maintain.

### 🔹 QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Tests all features to confirm they work as expected. They design test cases, perform manual and automated testing, and report bugs to maintain high-quality standards.

### 🔹 Project Manager 
Coordinates the team by defining tasks, timelines, and goals. They act as the bridge between developers and stakeholders, making sure the project stays on track.

### 🔹 UI/UX Designer
Although this is a backend-focused project, a UI/UX designer may contribute by **designing user-friendly interfaces** and ensuring smooth user flows when the frontend is built.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone project leverages a modern backend stack to ensure scalability, security, and efficiency. Below is an overview of the technologies used and their purpose in the project:

- **Django** – A high-level Python web framework for building the backend and handling business logic.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – Provides tools to build RESTful APIs for user, property, booking, and payment management.
- **PostgreSQL** – A powerful relational database system used for storing and querying project data efficiently.
- **GraphQL** – Allows flexible and efficient data queries, giving clients control over the data they fetch.
- **Celery** – Handles background tasks such as sending notifications, processing payments, or email confirmations.
- **Redis** – Used for caching frequently accessed data and managing asynchronous task queues with Celery.
- **Docker** – Provides containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automates testing, integration, and deployment processes to ensure code reliability and faster delivery.
