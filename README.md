  ## ✨ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project is built around a set of core features that directly support the project goals. These features ensure the platform is secure, reliable, and user-friendly.

### 👤 User Management
Implements secure registration, authentication, and profile management for both guests and hosts. This ensures that only authorized users can access the platform while providing a personalized experience.

### 🏡 Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and retrieve property listings with details like title, description, price, and location. This feature ensures properties are easy to manage and accessible to potential guests.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables guests to reserve properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The system prevents double bookings and manages reservation details for a smooth booking process.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Integrates a secure payment system to handle transactions for bookings. It records payment details, tracks statuses, and ensures financial operations are reliable and transparent.

### ⭐ Review System
Provides a way for guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties. This feature builds trust in the platform by helping future guests make informed decisions and motivating hosts to maintain quality.

### ⚡ Data Optimization
Optimizes the database to allow efficient storage and fast retrieval of information. This ensures the platform remains scalable and responsive, even as the number of users and properties grows.

## 🔒 API Security

Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is critical to protecting users, data, and financial transactions in the Airbnb Clone project. The following measures will be implemented:

### ✅ Authentication
Only verified users can access the system using secure login methods.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive features like bookings, payments, or user profiles.

### ✅ Authorization
Different roles (guest, host) will have restricted access to certain endpoints.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures that users can only perform actions they are permitted to, such as preventing guests from modifying other users’ properties.

### ✅ Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted both at rest and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).  
**Why it matters:** Protects user data from being intercepted or leaked during communication or storage.

### ✅ Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests an API can receive from a single client within a set timeframe.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents abuse such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or brute-force login attempts.

### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
All input data will be validated and sanitized before processing.  
**Why it matters:** Protects the system from SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other malicious exploits.

### ✅ Secure Payments
Payment APIs will integrate with trusted payment gateways and use tokenization for transactions.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures that sensitive financial information is never exposed, reducing fraud risks.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

A **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline** automates the process of testing, building, and deploying the application. This ensures that new changes are integrated smoothly, tested consistently, and delivered to production with minimal manual effort.

### 🔑 Why CI/CD is Important
- **Faster Development Cycles:** Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployments, allowing developers to focus on coding.  
- **Early Bug Detection:** Runs tests automatically on every commit, catching issues before they reach production.  
- **Reliable Deployments:** Ensures that each release is consistent, reducing the risk of deployment errors.  
- **Improved Collaboration:** Enables multiple developers to contribute without breaking the project.  

### 🛠 Tools for CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows like testing and deployment directly within GitHub.  
- **Docker:** Provides consistent containerized environments for running and deploying the app.  
- **Jenkins (optional):** A powerful CI/CD automation server for complex pipelines.  
- **Heroku/AWS/GCP (Deployment):** Cloud platforms that can host the application after successful builds.
